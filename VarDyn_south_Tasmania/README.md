Dataset of ocean sea surface height (SSH) across the Antarctic Circumpolar Current south of Tasmania generated with the VarDyn algorithm.
- the nadir-only version is created using SARAL/AltiKa, Cryosat-2, HaiYang-2B, Jason-3, Sentinel-3A&B, Sentinel 6A
- the SWOT-nadir version also incorporates data from the nadir altimeter from SWOT and KaRIn instrument

The nominal spatial and temporal resolution are 5km and 3h respectively.
